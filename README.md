### day14

I have used the `concurrent.futures` library in Python.
There are a total of four processes, with each process having 5
to 10 threads. I have counted the files in the `Texts`
folder, and ignored the `bncHdr.xml` file.

In my approach, I understand a word as everything except
punctuation marks. Therefore, I didn't parse the XML file
but treated it as plain text data for analysis.


### day13
Start the program by running `python ./day13_filegame.py`

> Type `enter` to go on in the terminal


### day12
- General data process program is in the `day12_pandas.py`
- Cli version of this is in the `rmxlsx.py`
 
  Use the following syntax: 
  ```shell
  python rmxlsx.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-n NUMBER] 
  
  # to get help, use:
  python ./rmxlsx.py -h
  ```

### day11
- **rename**
 
  `day11_rename` will automatically rename the files in the `testfiles` dir using threading.
- **translate**
 
  To view the results, please follow these steps:

  Run the `day11_translate.py` script.
  Access [Translation](https://localhost:5000) in your web browser. You will be able to see the results on the webpage.

### day10
- Written in python
  

### day09
- Very common, nothing special.

### day08-day01
这几道题看了，感觉比较基础。其中的知识点在后面的程序里也有体现。暂且搁置。👻

怎么要看这几天的作业啊，那 ~~随便写写吧~~ (解释一下)。

我是倒着写的，可以倒着看吗 🥺

#### day08
TypeHint在 `day13_filegame.py` 中用的挺多的

TypeHint是非强制的一般来说对编辑器有用的类型注释，方便debug吧

#### day07
创建文件和修改文件在多线程rename那里也有用到。

#### day06
元组... 似乎没什么特殊的

#### 有空补上
